                <h3> About Perry </h3>
                <p>Coding has always been something I've wanted to pursue since my childhood, and I'm now taking the steps to fulfill my dreams. </p>
                  <p>With the amount of time I've spent in clubs during school and working since my early high school years, I've developed a love for working with others, whether it be as a leader or part of a team.</p>   
                    <p>I enjoy working out since it helps me develop good habits and discipline. I also love thrifting for new clothes and updating my wardrobe.</p>
